# packagetrack
Track a list of packages based on their tracking numbers. Designed to work at the command line.

In order for this to work, please make sure that you've installed the selenium package for python as well as enabled the gmail api, which grants permission to search through your emails for tracking numbers. If you don't want to enable the gmail api, simply comment out the line ``` import getemails ```from completeScript.py.

To run the program, compile the program completeScript.py at the command line or in an IDE of your choice.
